# PHP-Test-form
 PHP Test number for Mario!

For testing: https://www.camillatofani.it/phpform/


## First track
Write a PHP script that, having taken 5 input values, sorts them in increasing order and for those that are not numbers, it returns an error message for each input.

## Second track
Let's make it more interesting: lists fields that are not numeric and numbers with commas must have only 2 decimals, otherwise they are not valid!
